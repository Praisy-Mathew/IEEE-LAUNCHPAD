| **Driver Drowsiness Detection Using CNN** |The Drowsiness Detection System, which is based on the driver's eye closure, can discern between normal eye twitch and drowsiness, as well as detect drowsiness when driving. The suggested scheme will help deter injuries caused by drowsy driving. Using a Haar cascade classifier, OpenCV was used to detect faces and eyes, and then a CNN model to predict the status. A alert signal is provided when the eyes are closed for an extended amount of time. Continuous eye closures are used to assess the driver's alertness level. Technology Used: Python,CNN,HTML,CSS, JAVASCRIPT .|
| **Malayalam Handwritten Character Recognition Using CNN**  |Built a website to recognize the malayalam handwritten characters using cnn. This project provides an overview about how to recognize the Malayalam characters using dataset that contains different characters.Technology Used: Python, Flask,HTML, CNN Model.|
 | **House Price Prediction using Python** | Built a website to predict the price of houses using python. This project provides an overview about how to predict houseâ€™s cost utilizing different data collected with the assistance of python libraries. Technology Used: Python, Flask, SQL, HTML,CSS.|
